# News-Article-Classification-and-Summarization

This project tackles the challenge of information overload in the digital age by classifying and summarizing news articles.  We aimed to empower users with efficient information consumption through concise summaries and personalized content recommendations.  Furthermore, the project benefits decision-makers by facilitating faster trend monitoring and informed choices through readily digestible key points from news sources.  By leveraging deep learning with large language models, we achieved accurate classification of news articles across various categories (business, sports, entertainment, etc.) and generated summaries that capture the essence of each article. This approach not only streamlines news consumption but also unlocks valuable insights for a wide range of stakeholders.
